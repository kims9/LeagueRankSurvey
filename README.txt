# LEAGUE OF LEGENDS
This is a survey in which the user can discover their potential rank in the game League of Legends.
 ### Process & Documentation
In order to calculate a users rank they first must enter in statistics about their gameplay into the
 form, using a slider that will auto update the value below it using javascript code the user can 
 enter information to be used in the next page. After submitting, the answers will calculate their rank
 based on the values submitted. This code allows for the script to take into account all of the data
 from the user. The images of the dragon aswel as the minions also update based on user input in the
 previous page
### Challenges & Struggles
I am currently having difficulty with linking the number of images to the number input.
